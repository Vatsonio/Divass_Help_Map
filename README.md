## Description

Hello everyone, we are The Divas team. We made this platform for coordinating the search for missing persons in the military conflict zone with our own efforts in 24 hours of painstaking work. The main idea was to make a one-page, non-scroll site that would simplify the search for missing soldiers and family members for volunteers and their families.

### DataBase:
MongoDB **[MongoDB Atlas(Cloud)](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas)** serves as our database. Three collections reside within this database:
- "users"
- "sessions"
